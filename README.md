# ASP.NET-Web-API-REST-Service
Representational State Tarnsfer(REST)

Objective:
Build a Web Service which should be cross functional and should be able to be consumed by any client. Traditional Web Services in .NET have to be consumed using a proxy. What if the client does not know how to create a proxy? It only knows to send basic HTTP verbs – GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE – to the server and expect XML or string as response. Enter the world of REST!!

Tech Stack:
Web API Web Application
Postman Client to view Get Requests from Server.
